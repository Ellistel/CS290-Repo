# CS290_Final_Repo

I have created three temporary HTML files for different functionalities within the project:

   1. index.html: This serves as the main page to display all blog posts made by the site owner.
   2. specificblogpost.html: This page is designed for users who click on a post from index.html. It provides more detailed information about the selected post and allows users to add comments.
   3.  adminpage.html: This page is intended for the blog owner to upload new blogs and manage content.
